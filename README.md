# Org ID finder

Search organisation names for their org-ids, as declared in IATI organisation files.

This works (more or less) as described by @stevieflow [on IATI discuss](https://discuss.iatistandard.org/t/getting-to-a-list-of-organisation-references-for-iati-publishers/1060). However:

 * Where there are multiple `iati-organisation`s, all of them are added
 * Where there are multiple languages used, all of them are added
